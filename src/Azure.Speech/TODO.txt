Goal: To show avatar responding to questions
1. Prompt question to the avatar
2. Avatar speaks the answer and moves its mouth


Prompt question to the avatar:
- How should I prompt the question to the avatar? Frontend buttons or CLI?

Avatar speaks the answer:
- Avatar needs to wait for the answer to be loaded before moving its mouth
- How to make the avatar move its mouth?

! Needs to rewrite the AudioPlayer class
- delete the AudioPlayer class
- write a LAppWavFileHandler class in Live2DCSharpSDK.App
	- Initialize

TODO first:
- create a button to prompt the question V (kinda)
- play the answer audio V
- move the avatar's mouth
- when the audio ends, stop the avatar's mouth

Optional:
- add message history

NEED TO BE FIXED:
- fix absolute path for the audio file in QnAMapper.cs
- add error handling in QnAMapper.cs
- remove unnecessary modules in the solution
