Goal: To show avatar responding to questions
1. Prompt question to the avatar
2. Avatar speaks the answer and moves its mouth


Prompt question to the avatar:
- How should I prompt the question to the avatar? Frontend buttons or CLI?

Avatar speaks the answer:
- Avatar needs to wait for the answer to be loaded before moving its mouth
- How to make the avatar move its mouth?


TODO first:
- create a button to prompt the question
- play the answer audio
- move the avatar's mouth
- when the audio ends, stop the avatar's mouth
